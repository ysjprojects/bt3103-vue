# bt3103-vue

## Guidelines
Due to Bootstrap's lack of support for Vue3, we will be reverting to use of Vue2 for development.
```
yarn add bootstrap bootstrap-vue
```

In addition, typescript will be used instead of Javascript for development.
```
yarn add typescript
```

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
