# bt3103-vue

## Modules
Due to Bootstrap's lack of support for Vue3, we will be reverting to use of Vue2 for development.
```
yarn add bootstrap bootstrap-vue
npm install bootstrap bootstrap-vue
```

In addition, typescript will be used instead of Javascript for development.
```
yarn add typescript
npm install typescript
```

## Project setup and initialisation
Create new project using yarn or npm.
```
yarn install
yarn create bt3103-vue
------------------------
vue create bt3103-vue
```

When asked to select a preset, select "Manually select features"
Leave all as default, ensure typescript is checked and select Vue2 as the main version.
